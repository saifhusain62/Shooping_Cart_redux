This project is a fully responsive Shopping Cart web application built using React, Redux Toolkit, React Router, Tailwind CSS, and DaisyUI.
The main goal of this application is to demonstrate how modern frontend tools can be combined to create a smooth and scalable e-commerce experience.

The application allows users to browse products, add or remove items from the cart, and view the total price dynamically, all powered by Redux state management for efficiency and consistency. With React Router, navigation between pages (such as Home, Products, and Cart) is seamless and fast.

The design is crafted with Tailwind CSS utilities and enhanced by DaisyUI pre-built components, resulting in a clean, modern, and fully responsive interface that works across devices. The project also focuses on maintaining a structured file system and reusable components, making it easy to scale and extend with additional features like authentication, payment integration, or order history in the future.

In short, this project is a practical implementation of state management, routing, and UI design in React, providing both developers and users with a smooth and intuitive shopping cart experience.
